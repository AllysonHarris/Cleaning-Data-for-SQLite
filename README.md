# Cleaning-Data-for-SQLite

This is an example of my ability to clean, configure, and manipulate a data set in preparation for easy and simple SQL querying. 

It's important to do things efficiently and with "best-practices" in mind. I typically make a first pass at a project and solve the problem in any way possible. Then I go back and refine the process to clean out unnecessary redundancy, promote modularity, and plan for any errors or exceptions that might occur. 

SQL querying is no different. While one large table could be managed, it's faster to query multiple tables using joins. When data only exists in one table, it's easier to update as well as more efficient as a storage methodology. This notebook shows the deconstruction of one table into three table (with an added fourth for more information).
